## db-table-py

The Python code provided connects to an SQLite database, retrieves a list of table names from that database, and then prints out the list of table names. Let's break down the code step by step:

Importing the SQLite module:

```
import sqlite3
```
This line imports the `sqlite3` module, which is the standard Python interface for working with SQLite databases. SQLite is a lightweight, file-based relational database management system.

Establishing a connection to the SQLite database:

```
connection = sqlite3.connect("gta.db")
```
This line establishes a connection to an SQLite database named "data.db" (assuming the file "data.db" exists in the current directory). If the database file does not exist, SQLite will create it.

Creating a cursor object:

```
cursor = connection.cursor()
```
This line creates a cursor object. A cursor is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database. In this code, the cursor will be used to execute a query to retrieve table names.

Querying for table names:
```
table_list = [a for a in cursor.execute("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table'")]
```
This line executes an SQL query against the SQLite database. The query selects the "name" column from the "sqlite_master" table where the "type" is equal to 'table'. In SQLite, the "sqlite_master" table contains metadata about the database, including information about tables and other objects.

The result of the query is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a single table name. The list comprehension [a for a in ...] is used to extract the table names from the query result and store them in the table_list variable.

Printing the list of table names:
```
print(table_list)
```
This line simply prints the table_list variable, which contains the names of all the tables in the SQLite database.

Closing the database connection:
```
connection.close()
```
This line closes the connection to the SQLite database.

In summary, this Python code connects to an SQLite database, retrieves the names of all tables in that database using an SQL query, stores the table names in a list, prints the list of table names, and then closes the database connection. This can be useful for inspecting the structure of a SQLite database and getting a list of its tables.
